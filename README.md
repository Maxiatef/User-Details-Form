# User-Details-Form
The User Details Form Project is a web application that allows users to fill out a form with their personal information, such as name, email, gender, and email subscription status. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and PHP and serves as a simple example of form validation and data storage in a MySQL database.

## Features:
-User-Friendly Interface: The project provides a user-friendly interface where users can easily enter their details through input fields and select their gender and email subscription status using radio buttons and checkboxes.

-Form Validation: The application includes form validation to ensure that all required fields are filled before submitting the form. If any required field is left blank, the user will be prompted with an error message.

-Data Storage: Upon submission, the user data is stored in a MySQL database, ensuring that the information is safely retained for future reference.

-View User Details: The project includes a separate page to view the user details stored in the database. Users can access this page to see a table displaying the names, emails, genders, and email subscription status of all users who have submitted the form.
